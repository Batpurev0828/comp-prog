# Contest folder

Directory for competitive programming contests

Meant to be cloned into Visual Studio Code as the .vscode directoryx is configured for it.

Building a source code for the first time will create a directory called **executables** where well.. the executables go.

**Input** and **outputs** come in and come out from **input.txt** and **output.txt** subdirectory called **IO**. 

Have fun (or not) coding!
